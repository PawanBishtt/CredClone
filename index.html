        <h1>the story of <br> CRED begins <br> with trust.</h1>
        <p>trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every <br>great human achievement. and
            consistently, its importance has <br>been overlooked. not just by individuals, but by entire societies. we
            <br>felt
            it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves. <br>especially for the ones who live by this virtue:
            the
            trustworthy.
            <br>
            <br>
            so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for <br>doing good and being trustworthy. this
            way,
            trust as a virtue <br>becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should be. then we <br>went one step
            ahead: we
            built it. we know we are on the right <br>track because here you are.
            <br>
            <br>
            if you make it to CRED, congratulations and welcome. we have a <br>lot of things planned for you.
